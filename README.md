graduation thesis

any code of this repo are not usable because we push something to this repo as backup of our storage labs

## repo description

This repo is for our graduation thesis(GT). most, not all, materials of our GT are in this repo. We will hold a presentation of this GT in August 2024.

## main topic of research

evaluation of prototype electrode module for measuring ECG

We conduct this research to measure performance of electrode using AGPossÂ® fibre on IoT ECG measuring device.

We compare the electrode to fastclip, which are used in medical diagnostics.

## Background

Medical-use device is expensive or difficult to operate (for people not friendly to technologies).

## Motivation

Medical device for everyone

- Medical-use system in simple mechanism and low cost (to buy, and operate)

## Method

Make ECG measuring module using IoT prototyping pratform.

Daily-use device does not need high acculacy like that of medical-use device.

## Brief description of procedure

1. Make electrode module
2. signal measurement test
3. applying filter method for noise reduction
4. evaluate signal quality

## Task List - Entire

- make measuring module (not electrodes)
- signal measuring test (with fastclip)
- make prototype electrode module 
- signal measuring test (with that prototype)
- analyse RAW signal to obtain noise effects not related to device
- construct optimal experiment environment
- apply FIR filter using Kaiser window ... in progress
- analyse filtered signal
- ???
- ??? (after complete GT)

## Shinchoku

- Measurement ECG of human body with two types of electrode
