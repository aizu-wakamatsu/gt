any code of this repo are not usable because we push something to this repo as backup of our storage labs

## repo desc

This repo is for our graduation thesis(GT). Main purpose of this GT research is to find how useful the prototype by our research. To evaluate our prototype, we made some small programs.

## main topic of research

evaluation of prototype electrode module for measuring ECG

We conduct this research to measure performance of electrode using AGPossÂ® fibre on IoT ECG measuring device.

We compare the electrode to fastclip, which are used in medical diagnostics.

## Background

Medical-use device is expensive or difficult to operate.

## Motivation

Medical device for everyone

- Medical-grade system in simple mechanism and low cost (to buy, and operate)

## Method

Make ECG measuring module using IoT prototyping pratform.

Daily-use device does not need high acculacy like that of medical-use device.

## List

1. Make electrode module
2. signal measurement test
3. applying filter method for noise reduction
4. evaluate signal quality

## Progress

- make measuring module
- signal measuring test (with fastclip)
- make prototype electrode module
- signal measuring test (with prototype)
- analyse RAW signal to obtain noise effects not related to device
- construct optimal experiment environment
- apply FIR filter using Kaiser window ... in progress
- analyse filtered signal
- ???
